## JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES:-
## js is a prototype based language

## OOP- Its a programming paradymn - structure of writing a program

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase(), promises etc

## why use oop?---> to solve sphagetti code(mix code)

## components/parts of Oop
-object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars of oop
- Abstraction - > hiding details ->  eg.(fetch)
- Encapsulation - > wrap up of data
- Inheritance - > prototype
- Polymorphism - > many forms of one method

## protoypial inhritance behaviour of javascript--

-Array is also an object which has no parent so its value is NULL on prototype referncing.

-String-object-NULL

--everything in js is an object

-function is a function also and also an object

-even if something is not object you can make it use object properties

--object proptoype is NULL
